Project Overview
Optimization models help improve decision-making by identifying the best possible solutions within given constraints. This project focuses on building an optimization model for predicting student performance based on various factors such as study hours, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep duration, and practice tests. The goal is to identify key factors that contribute to high academic performance and optimize study strategies to maximize student success.

Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to analyze student performance data and develop an optimization model to maximize the "Performance Index" score. The key steps include:

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and normalizing the dataset to ensure consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying correlations between features like study habits, sleep patterns, and scores.
Feature Engineering – Selecting the most relevant features that impact student performance.
Predictive Modeling – Using machine learning algorithms to predict performance.
Optimization Model Implementation – Applying optimization techniques such as Linear Programming (LP), Gradient Descent, and Genetic Algorithms to maximize student performance.
Evaluation & Refinement – Testing the model’s accuracy and improving it through hyperparameter tuning.
Why is Optimization in Student Performance Important?
✔ Personalized Learning – Helps students focus on key areas for improvement.
✔ Efficient Study Plans – Determines the best balance between study hours, extracurricular activities, and sleep.
✔ Data-Driven Decision Making – Enables educators and students to take actions based on real insights.
✔ Maximizing Academic Success – Provides recommendations for students to achieve their highest potential.

Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project includes:

Hours Studied – The total time dedicated to studying.
Previous Scores – Historical academic performance.
Extracurricular Activities – Participation in activities outside academics.
Sleep Hours – Impact of sleep on learning efficiency.
Sample Question Papers Practiced – Number of practice tests attempted.
Performance Index – The target variable measuring student success.
Model Development & Optimization
To achieve the best results, the following methodologies will be used:
✔ Regression Models (Linear & Polynomial) – To predict student performance based on study-related factors.
✔ Machine Learning Models (Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks) – To analyze complex relationships between variables.
✔ Optimization Techniques (Linear Programming, Gradient Descent, Genetic Algorithms) – To maximize student performance by adjusting study strategies.
